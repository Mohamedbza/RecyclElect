🔧 Task: Rebuild the homepage and UI of the website “RecyclElect” with a more modern, creative, and polished design that matches the brand's eco-tech identity.
🧠 Context: This platform is an e-commerce site dedicated to buying used laptops and spare parts in Canada, focused on sustainability and accessibility.
📑 Main Requirements:
Hero Section:
Add a large, clean headline with multi-color gradient text on "Seconde Vie" to reflect a fresh tech look.
Subheading must promote second-hand electronics as economical, ecological, and reliable.
Add 2 clear CTA buttons: “Je vends” (primary) and “J’achète” (secondary), animated on hover.
Use a high-quality vector background illustration or subtle animated SVG related to electronics recycling or second-hand laptops.
Services Section:
Redesign the “Je vends / J’achète / Nous contacter” cards with icon animations, shadow elevation on hover, and clearer spacing.
Use icons from a modern library like Lucide or Phosphor Icons.
Produits en Vedette:
Apply a uniform card design with stronger separation and spacing.
Add hover effects (scale, shadow) and improve typography (e.g., using Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans).
Add small badge (e.g. "Reconditionné", "Garantie 6 mois") on top-left of each card.
Pièces de Rechange:
Improve layout and alignment. Ensure fallback image is handled properly when the image is missing.
Add hover overlay with quick preview and CTA like “Voir pièces compatibles”.
Engagements Section:
Make it more visible: add a title with better contrast, use icons, background gradients or split sections with white and light-gray alternance.
Témoignages:
Use carousel/slider format with animated transitions or card layout with light blur background and gradient borders.
Footer:
Add background illustration (subtle circuit board or green tech pattern).
Enhance contrast, spacing, and clickable social icons.
Improve alignment and hierarchy (ex. contact infos clearly separated, better spacing in navigation).
🛒 E-commerce requirements:
Product cards must include: image, price in $CAD, short description, green CTA “Voir détails”, and optional tag for "complet" or "pièce".
All links and buttons must be clearly identifiable and follow accessibility best practices (WCAG compliant).
🎨 Design style:
Fresh, modern, professional, slightly playful
Color palette inspired by green (#32CD32), electric blue (#00BFFF), black/gray (#1C1C1E), and white.
Use spacing, hierarchy and font sizes properly. No hard-coded elements. Make everything responsive and consistent.
✅ Important rules:
Don’t use hardcoded texts or styles.
Create each section as a reusable component.
Name files and components clearly (HeroSection.tsx, TestimonialCard.tsx, etc).
Store assets and configs in /assets, /config, /data.
Follow TypeScript best practices.
Use TailwindCSS with predefined themes for colors and spacing.
